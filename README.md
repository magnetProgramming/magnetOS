# magnetOS

magnetOS is a small 16-bit real mode operating system built as a learning project.  
The goal is to understand how an OS works at the lowest level, from bootloader to basic applications.

## Goals
- Simple games  
- A basic GUI inspired by MikeOS  
- A minimal scripting system  
- Small built-in applications
